# Ceasar-Cipher
Encrypts a string with the Ceasar's Cipher technique

**Ideas used:**

1. `String manipulation` - Change a character to its ordinal number
2. `Array manipulation` - Modify, join, and iterate over several items
3. `Control Flow` - Create predicate methods and simple conditions that handle special cases
4. `Regex` - Recognize if a character is in lowercase or uppercase
